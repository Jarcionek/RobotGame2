This was the first larger program I wrote - after 6 weeks of learning programming.
Now used as an exercise to practice refactoring legacy code.

The main goals are:
- add tests for the program (currently there are no tests at all)
- isolate business logic from user interface
- replace javadocs with "documentation by tests"
- fix violations of single responsibility principle
- split large classes into smaller ones using dependency injection
- fix formatting, spelling and all violations of code conventions (such as naming and incorrect white spaces)
- clean the code, make it easy to read and understand it

Once done, it should be easy to implement new features such as:
- new attributes
- new bonuses
- new commands
- perks (special commands available only to player with that perk)
- collecting and equipping items
- better graphics
